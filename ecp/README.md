##### Ethereum chain parser

**E**thereum **C**hain **P**arser listens for Ethereum (block) chain events and turns them into MongoDB
records (currently). This could be easily extended to allow importing to
various database formats. These records can be accessed from a third client application.

It's currently being used for the Ethereum chain explorer.

This is still pre-Alpha software, not ready for production.
